    <h2>Summary Of Born A Crime</h2>
    <div id="content">
    <p>The first two chapters of Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime” talk about Trevor Noah’s journey.<br> 
        The racial injustices and how there was inequality in South Africa. He talks about the Immorality Act of 1927,<br>
        a South African law that criminalized sexual relationships between whites and people of color. <br>
        These set the stage for the exploration of racial tensions, discrimination, and the impact of apartheid on <br>
        individuals and families.Patricia, Noah's mum ran away from home to live and work in Johannesburg.<br>
        She had to hide because she could not trust anyone and it was illegal for Black people to live in the city. <br>
        Noah was “a mixed child” and had to hide most of the time so as not to be seen and this affected his<br> 
        relationship with his father. He talks about his home country’s history, culture, and traditions.<br>
        Noah's journey is a narrative of racial injustice and the struggle for equality in South Africa. <br>
        Trevor’s mother was a devout Christian who took her family to multiple churches every Sunday.<br>
        Before apartheid separated South Africa’s people by color, Black South Africans were divided into tribes. <br>
        These tribes had a long history of conflict, with the Zulu and the Xhosa. Xhosa women were seen as prostitutes and<br>
         when Noah was traveling with his mom, a bus driver criticized her for traveling with children without a man late at night.<br>
        In Machakos County, tribalism is a main challenge as one tribe is favored. A certain tribe gets it easy with jobs<br>
        and even resources while others are left behind. These highly contribute to there being classes of those who are <br>
        poor and rich. Single mothers are mostly judged in society for not having a man and are viewed as immoral in the society.<br>
        In society, women are religious. You will find that apart from going to church on Sundays, women have fellowships,<br>
        women’s day, and meetings in between the week. They are the backbone of Christianity in their households and ensure <br>
        their children go to church. Most of the time they move from one church to another. They believe that Each church <br>
        offers something different.Insecurity is a day-to-day issue addressed as many people do not have a source of <br>
        income and they revolt against stealing.Matatu and Uber drivers are at times involved in crimes and attack their passengers.<br>
         The matatu’s drivers fight over customers and they use vulgar language addressing each other.
